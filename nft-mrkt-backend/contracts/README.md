I think this is a REALLY good idea.      
It will allow us to use COVALENT a lot.       
We can grab whatever address is connected via metamask and search for the SINGLE contract they're an admin of (that could be tricky. Can we cache with covalent?).     
After we have that single contract, well know DIRECTLY what to ask covalent for.      
We will run a for loop for the length of the contracts array and populate all of their product lines and all of the NFT's that they have inside of them, sold or unsold.       
THis will use covalent heavily
