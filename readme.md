Zelda allows makers and owners to create links between their physical items and the blockchain. 
For makers, the application provides a way to upload images and metadata for real-world products, 
create digital tokens representing those items (along with corresponding QR codes), 
and offer them for sale in a decentralized marketplace. 

For buyers, the application allows them to browse available collections in the marketplace, 
buy a token from a collection, and see the current tokens they own.
